                <h2>The Fuelfree Generator produces electricity, by harnessing the thermal energy of its surrounding air.</h2>

                <p>
                    <ul class="default">
                        <li>The generator produces an electromagnetic wave which polarises the air. This creates a decrease in the air molecules' degrees of freedom, and as a result, a decrease in the air's kinetic energy.</li>
                        <li>The air temperature in a diameter of about 3 meters around the generator drops by about 7°C.</li>
                        <li>
                            The outside environment, further away from the generator, is enticed to transfer heat into this relatively cold area, as heat flows from the hotter to the colder region.<br />
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In the meantime the electromagnetic wave loses some of its energy.<br />
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This allows the kinetic energy contributed by the outside environment to have a greater impact on the air molecules closer to the generator.<br />
                        </li>
                        <br />
                        <li>
                            As the air molecules' kinetic energy increase again, they act as tiny electric dipoles, and the resulting (statistical) effect is to strengthen the electromagnetic wave.<br />
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The stronger electromagnetic wave begins a new cycle, by cooling the air again.<br />
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This oscillatory cycle is maintained, and the environment continues to pour thermal energy to the generator's vicinity.<br />
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This energy sustains the electromagnetic wave, and produces a magnetic effect inside the generator.<br />
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The magnetic effect is used in order to generate electricity.<br />
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            There is no need to store the electricity, as it can be supplied on-demand.<br />
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h2>The FFG</h2>


                The Fuelfree Generator is a about 70cm by 70cm by 50cm in size.<br />
                <br />
                The first generation FFGs will each deliver a continuous supply of electricity at a sustained rate of at least 3kWh. This is equal to more than 2000 kWh per month. According to the <a href="http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=97&t=3">U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)</a> the average U.S. residential customer consumes about 900 kWh per month.<br />
                <br />
                It is hard to determine the final cost of an FFG, but we estimate that the final cost of a first generation FFG will not exceed 3000 USD.<br />
